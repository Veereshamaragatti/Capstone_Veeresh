1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
all the three IP by NB files.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,299
You're free to collaborate with your classmates,

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,519
but just write the name of

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,679
the people you collaborated with at the top of the worksheet.

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,779
I'll just introduce the worksheets to you guys.

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,140
Worksheet 2 is on simple linear regression and

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,559
multiple linear regression.

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,719
You'll have to just plot a scatter plot and build a linear regression model.

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,719
You have to check if it follows the OLS assumptions and

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,539
validate the linear regression model.

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,439
Then the multiple linear regression you have to plot a

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:45,320
correlogram and check which contributes most to the target variable

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,079
and build a multiple linear regression model based on that.

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,600
Worksheet 2B is based on

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,799
a regression, lasso and a elastic regression.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,119
You have to build all these three models.

17
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,500
Worksheet 2C is on logistic regression.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,579
You have to just build a logistic regression model and

19
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,260
a lot of the ROC curve and you see value.

20
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,579
So the last day to submit will be 20th September.

21
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,780
Before constructing the correlogram,

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,560
you can use anything label encoding or one more encoding.

23
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,319
Just convert.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,519
You can ask your doubts in the chat or you can raise your hand

25
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,340
will unmute you.

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,019
There will be another TA session four or five days before that it

27
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:42,840
lines. So by then your portion should be covered so you'll be able to

28
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,079
solve and ask more questions that time.

29
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,260
But if you have any doubts, you can put it in the chat or unmute

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,159
a razor hand will unmute.

31
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,959
You can just use the libraries to build the model.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Like for linear regression model, you can use LM and for

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,239
worksheet 2B, you can use GLMnet.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,039
You need not build one from scratch.

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,340
Just import the libraries.

36
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,639
You can use any library you want.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,500
There is no completion on the syntax.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,580
You can use any syntax or any libraries you want.

39
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:21,780
Which question?

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,199
Three, the OLS assumptions.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,500
Yeah, for OLS assumptions, you can do like three.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,759
You can check if the residuals are residuals for the normal

43
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,759
distribution.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,080
You can check for homosodacity and you can check for the linear

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,580
relationship.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
You can do three.

47
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:42,819
That's enough.

48
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,039
Does that answer your question?

49
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,379
Yeah, if you put it as a markdown, it will be better and professional.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,439
If you answer in terms of if it's code then use the code.

51
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:06,060
Both graphs and write ups because try to add your analysis as much as

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,639
possible, not only code.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,379
So add comments or markdowns for whatever you are plotting.

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,240
Ignite, you can unmute and ask the question.

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,780
Yes.

56
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,120
Inverse, you have professional sense, right?

57
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,319
You need to answer in text form or watch.

58
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,539
Yeah, that's what I answered.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,099
You can add a markdown cell and answer in that cell after each question.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
That's the answer your question.

61
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:52,379
Yeah, Rohan, the histogram of residuals is enough for normal distribution.

62
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,919
But do add like a text cell scene.

63
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,580
Just don't add the code, guys.

64
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:08,639
Just don't write the code for plotting histogram and leave it like to add analysis of the graph.

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,780
Oh, yeah.

66
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,979
Markdown code, markdown code.

67
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,379
Just add markdowns wherever whenever you want to write the text or analysis

68
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:20,540
and code cells when you want to execute the code.

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,420
Are there any more questions or we shall end the month?

70
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,500
There will be another TS session,

71
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,740
four or five days before the deadline.

72
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,800
So you guys should, the portion should be covered by them.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,519
So you guys should be able to solve that time.

74
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,240
About the hackathon, we'll let you know soon.

75
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,759
Do you guys have any more questions?

76
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,360
Okay, that will end the month.

77
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,660
Thank you for joining us.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,519
If any of you missed the first part of this session,

79
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,379
we'll make the recording available.

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,019
You guys can catch up with that.

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,879
Thank you.
